His usual outfit is composed of a green jacket with reddish edges covering a black or white tank top underneath, green short shorts, and green, laced boots. In some arcs such as the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs he takes off the jacket and wears only the tank top.

                <h2>Killua Zoldyck</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Killua Zoldyck is the third child of Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck and the heir of the Zoldyck Family, until he runs away from home and becomes a Rookie Hunter. He is the best friend of Gon Freecss and is currently traveling with Alluka Zoldyck.
                He has served as the deuteragonist for the series, having said role in the Heavens Arena, Greed Island, and Chimera Ant arcs. He was the main protagonist of the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc. He also was the tritagonist of the Hunter Exam arc and the Yorknew City arc.</p>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Killua has spiky silver hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes. His eyes change shape depending on the mood that he's in, narrowing and sharpening when he goes into assassination mode. Killua is fairly lean at the start of the series, due to constant physical conditioning and torture training he received when he was young. As time passes, he becomes more muscular and toned. In the Nippon Animation anime adaptation, Killua's eye color is changed to green during the OVAs. He is also often seen holding a green skateboard (turned yellow in the 2011 series).</p>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Initially, Killua is introduced as a character who appears similar to Gon: cheeky, cheerful, and full of mischievous ideas. However, contrasting Gon's politeness, Killua can be quite rude to others, mostly strangers and older people. He is most commonly known for having a sweet tooth; he loves everything sweet and spent almost Jenny Symbol 2011.svg200 million on snacks when he was at the Heavens Arena. His favorite snack is chocolate, specifically Chocolate Balls and Chocolate Robots.
                Despite his horrendous upbringings and the torturous training his family has put him under, Killua has managed to remain generally positive and does not seem too psychologically affected by the pain he's endured, demonstrating a noble, pure side of him. When showcasing his abilities and turning his Nen into electricity, both Netero and Biscuit have noted how truly tragic his childhood must have been, with the former stating that it's a miracle Killua is even able to smile at all.
                However, his ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him—deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. This side fades as he spends more time with Gon, although he is still unafraid to threaten or kill anyone who attacks him or Gon. Conflicting with Killua's predisposal to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his friends and natural kindness. He claims Gon was his first friend, and he grows progressively more attached to him as time passes. Killua often suffers immensely in his attempts to help his friends without a single complaint. He puts others before himself without being concerned about his own health or even his life.

                <h2>Kurapika</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Kurapika is the last survivor of the Kurta Clan. He is a Blacklist Hunter and the current leader of the organization founded by Light Nostrade. He is a member of the Zodiacs with the codename "Rat". His goal is to avenge his clan and recover the remaining Scarlet Eyes.
                He takes the role of the main protagonist in the Yorknew City and Succession Contest arcs. He was also the deuteragonist of the Hunter Exam arc.</p>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Kurapika has medium blond hair with brown eyes; blue in the 1999 anime adaptation (grey/dark grey in the 2011 anime adaptation). His eyes glow a beautiful and coveted scarlet when experiencing intense emotion. In his first appearance in the series, he wears a blue tabard decorated with an orange-colored (red in the 2011 anime adaptation) hem and a white full-body training suit underneath. He changes his tabard and training suit for the duration of the Yorknew City arc. His shoes are Chinese-style winkle-picker flats.</p>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Kurapika is a cool and intelligent individual, possessing vast knowledge. He is reticent; not one to open up to people easily and quite judgmental. His distance from others initially keeps him level-headed and moralistic, but his heart has been poisoned with sadness and hatred. Having been traumatized from losing everyone he loved at the age of twelve, Kurapika closes his heart to new people and remains introverted as to stay focused on his goal. However, Kurapika can be kind and affectionate, smiling when those friends are happy. Though Kurapika outwardly states that he desires to become a Blacklist Hunter and his ultimate goal is to capture the band of thieves that massacred his family, he is willing to compromise his personal morality and delve into the squalid side of society in order to achieve his goal. He is prone to fits of uncontrollable anger should the memory of his clan be insulted in any way.
                After becoming a professional Hunter, Kurapika starts upon a self-destructive path. His anger leads him to commit villainous acts of wrath as catharsis for his pain. Kurapika's reserved demeanor makes him very ruthless and unreasonable at times, but his friends are the only ones able to slightly settle his seething enough for him to think rationally. He slowly transitioned from considering his friendships to be a weakness hindering him from succeeding in his aims to appreciating their value, and he was willing to put his revenge on the Phantom Troupe on hold for his friends' well-being. He even questioned the legitimacy of his quest after experiencing the deep ties that bind the Spiders together, particularly Pakunoda's loyalty, although it ultimately did not deter him.</p>

                <h2>Leorio Paradinight </h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Leorio Paradinight is a Rookie Hunter and a member of the Zodiacs with the codename "Boar" (亥い, I). He is currently a medical student, with a goal to become a doctor.</p>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Leorio is a tall, manly-looking, fairly muscular young man with small brown eyes, black hair, and a spiked crew cut. He typically wears a dark blue business suit, black shoes, and a pair of tea shade sunglasses. Some of the characters such as Killua near at the beginning of the story mistake Leorio for an old man, but he is actually a lot younger than he looks, being a teenager at the start of the series.</p>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p class="wordWarp">Leorio is initially introduced as a very selfish narcissist who places great emphasis on material wealth. Despite his assertions that he is only after money, he eventually reveals to Kurapika that his dream is to one day become a doctor in order to help the poor. He believes that all things in the world (lives, dreams, etc.) can be bought and that becoming a Hunter will provide him with the necessary funds for his medical education. Due to his first spat with Kurapika, as well as the test on the way to the navigator's cabin, it seems that he has a sensitivity for those who do not take him seriously or treat him with disrespect. His real priorities seem to be friends first, then his dream of becoming a great doctor, with everything else afterward.
                Leorio is not one to balk and retreat when faced with overwhelming odds in battle. A loyal, trustworthy ally who greatly values the ties of friendship, he acts like the 'big brother' of the group. He often provides comic relief; Killua sometimes ridicules him for his comparatively older age, although he swears that his appearance is that of a mere teenager. His impulsive and brash nature has sometimes caused more trouble for the people around him. Another flair he has is his ability to 'straight-talk' through many situations at hand. It could be seen that his closest relationship in the group is with Kurapika because they have spent the most time with each other.</p>
